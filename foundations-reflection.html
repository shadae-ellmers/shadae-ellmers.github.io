      <p>The three new things I have learnt about myself and ego due to the core learning is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I doubt myself intensely, which holds me back from my full potential.</li>
        <li>Distractions are a huge inhibitor of my learning.</li>
        <li>I always thought listening to music was a source of distraction for my productivity, 
          but instead puts me in a positive mood which boosts my productivity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By prioritising my values, practising empathy, and being self-aware, I am contributing 
        to growing my emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence plays an important role in 
        learning as it allows for better problem solving and communication. In turn, these are 
        the foundations for learning growth and programming.</p>
      <p>In the core learning, I was surprised the most by learning that I inhibit my personal 
        growth. I discovered that my biggest barrier towards my development was my inner voice, 
        telling me that what I was doing was too hard and that I just don’t understand it. Since 
        understanding this I have put so much work into turning this into a ‘yet’ mindset and it 
        has greatly improved my attitude towards problem solving.</p>
      <p>The most challenging aspects of the core learning was the listening exercises. As I 
        struggle with giving into distractions, I found that giving someone my 100% focus was 
        very difficult.</p>
      <p>I think Dev Academy spend so much time on core skills because anyone can learn code. If 
        anyone can learn code, then it’s the personal skills that differ candidates when hiring. 
        Anyone can learn new code skills on the job, but it’s a lot harder to pick up and teach 
        emotional intelligence and communication on the job.</p>
      <p>Learning core material does not feel like a waste of time. Without it, I would have had a 
        completely different mindset going into the tech learning. I likely would have given up a 
        lot quicker, talked negatively upon myself, and worked less efficiently while programming.</p>
