      <!--Tell your non tech friend a story about a time you were blocked on a simple problem-->
      <!--what was the problem?-->
      <p>
        The whole premise of the piece of code I was stuck on was to create a gradebook, where I was given two sets 
        of information (arrays), one with student names and the other with their test scores. With each task required, 
        I wanted to create a new function to change the initial code, instead of manually changing the original code
        so I could have a visual history of my steps. I knew this would be a challenge for me and boy was I right. The 
        main block was where I was writing a function for the computer to add a new score a specific student's list of scores.
      </p>
      <!--what problem solving techniques did you use?-->
      <p>
        I utilised many problem solving techniques, including trying something, reading error messages, and googling. Ultimately,
        what had helped me get past the block was relising that other classmates had trouble with the same task and were in the
        same position as me, and had asked for help from other classmates before I could reach out. 
      </p>
      <!--how did you feel throughout the process?-->
      <p>
        It was frustrating at times but I knew that by remaining calm and trying new processes of problem solving that I would 
        eventually get there.
      </p>
      <!--what did you learn?-->
      <p>
        Through this I learned that getting blocked usually isn't a personal problem. I typically get into the negative
        mindspace of believing that my lack of ability is what is causing the block. Through this block, I understand better
        that everyone else is also sturggling, and that I will get there eventually and grow from it.
