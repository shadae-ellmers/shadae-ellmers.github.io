      <!--Tell your non tech friend a story about a time you were blocked on a simple problem-->
      <!--what was the problem?-->
      <p>
        The whole premise of the piece of code I was stuck on was to create a gradebook, where I was given two sets 
        of information (arrays), one with student names and the other with their test scores. With each task required, 
        I wanted to create a new function to change the initial code, instead of manually changing the original code
        so I could have a visual history of my steps. I knew this would be a challenge for me and boy was I right. The 
        main block was where I was writing a function for the computer to add a new score a specific student's list of scores.
      </p>
      <!--what problem solving techniques did you use?-->
      <p>
        I utilised many problem solving techniques, including trying something, reading error messages, and googling. Ultimately,
        what had helped me get past the block was relising that other classmates had trouble with the same task and were in the
        same position as me, and had asked for help from other classmates before I could reach out. 
      </p>
      <!--how did you feel throughout the process?-->
      <p>
        It was frustrating at times but I knew that by remaining calm and trying new processes of problem solving that I would 
        eventually get there.
      </p>
      <!--what did you learn?-->
      <p>
        Through this I learned that getting blocked usually isn't a personal problem. I typically get into the negative
        mindspace of believing that my lack of ability is what is causing the block. Through this block, I understand better
        that everyone else is also sturggling, and that I will get there eventually and grow from it.

      <!--what was the problem?-->
      <p>
        Though the last situation was a long, winding road to solve, this situation was smooth. For this task, I was required 
        to write a function that gives the number back that I gave. Of course, there were a few exceptions where it would 
        give a word instead of the number. Now I knew I coudl smash this one out of the park, so completed it pretty quickly. 
        But then, I was thrown a more difficult task, to have the function give back multiple numbers put in (an array) with the
        same word exceptions. 
      </p>
      <!--what problem-solving techniques did you use?-->
      <p>
        I knew I had to go through the task step by step to understand it so I broke down what I was being asked into smaller tasks 
        and wrote them down (pseudocode). Then, I worked by way through the mini tasks, and tested them to see if they'd work. If 
        something didn't work, I'd read the error message to get a sense of what is wrong, and I'd try something else. After a quick 
        google search, I came across a different method of what I was trying to do and I managed to figure it out.
      </p>
      <!--how did you feel throughout the process?-->
      <p>
        I felt pretty calm throughout this process, especially compared to the last situation. 
      </p>
      <!--what did you learn?-->
      <p>
        I learned that using pseudocode, with breaking down the task into smaller pieces, really helped me avoid getting majorly 
        blocked and not knowing what to do. This way it was also eaiser to tell where my problem was with error messages and 
        problem-solve faster.

      <!--Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes-->
      <p>
        To portray how I'm feeling about using each problem-solving tool I have in my belt, I'm going to give each one a rating out 
        of 5 based on confidence. A rating of 1 means not confident at all, 3 is neutral, and 5 is very confident.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode = 5</li>
        <li>Trying something = 4</li>
        <li>Rubber ducky method = 3</li>
        <li>Reading error messages = 4</li>
        <li>Console.logging = 2</li>
        <li>Googling = 5</li>
        <li>Asking peers for help = 1</li>
        <li>Asking coaches for help = 1</li>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection = 2</li>
