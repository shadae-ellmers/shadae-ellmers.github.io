        <p>I want to use the skills gained from this course to land a junior software developing 
          role. I want to be able to help people create what they’re wanting through code.</p>
        <p>My strengths and limitations have not changed from foundations through to bootcamp. 
          I believe I learn best when creativity is involved, and struggle to involve myself on 
          discord outside of reading threads. I do not believe this will hinder me as badly during 
          bootcamp, as learning in person forces me to communicate and I cannot avoid physical 
          interactions compared to learning online.</p>
        <p>When I think about the non-technical challenges that I could face in bootcamp, there 
          are a few that stand out. When I was completing my last degree, I had a problem with 
          staying on top of the material. I have learnt a lot from the core skills in foundations 
          and so I don’t think this is the biggest challenge, but I do worry that it will creep up 
          on me. Secondly, speaking in front of a group heightens my anxiety. Last time I spoke in 
          front of people, I checked my watch which told me my heart rate was at 105bpm. Hopefully, 
          this won’t become I big challenge as I get to know everyone better and feel both comfortable 
          around others and more confident in my abilities. In bootcamp I want to work on getting 
          out of my comfort zone with speaking in front of groups and communicating.</p>
          <p>My expectations from the bootcamp team looks like encouragement. I don’t like to have 
            high expectations of others but getting supportive words and constructive feedback 
            would be beneficial for my experience.</p>
          <p>In bootcamp, I will commit to scheduling my time efficiently. If what I’m working on 
            exceeds the time set aside and I’ve exhausted personal methods of problem solving, I 
            will ask others for help.</p>

        <h2>Foundations</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>My long-term goal career-wise is to become a senior software developer, hopefully 
          self-employed as I want to have flexibility in my life. To do this, I want to start as a 
          junior developer and work my way up in a company for a long time to gain skills and 
          experience.</p>
        <p>My biggest strength with my learning is creativity. I learn well when I can transform the 
          content into an analogy or present it artistically. My biggest limitation is being easily 
          distracted. I find it difficult to get into the focus zone, and end distracted by everything 
          else going around me. I believe this is because I see more excitement in other activities 
          as I don’t prioritise the importance of my goals.</p>
        <p>I have a few skills I want to develop while at Dev Academy. Most importantly, as it is my 
          biggest limitation, I want to be able to develop my focus skills. Another big skill I want 
          to develop is my communication skills. I find it difficult to reach out when needed and 
          avoid teamwork, which is detrimental to me if I want to succeed in this industry.</p>
        <p>I will manage my workload in this programme by committing to a spread schedule across the 
          week and taking frequent breaks. This is primarily to help me stay focussed on my workload 
          so that I can avoid procrastination and not burn out by overloading myself. This strategy 
          will make me reliable with my learning and projects by avoiding slacking in my workload, 
          which puts more pressure onto other learners and facilitators. When things build up and 
          start to get to me, my plan is to take a step back and take a break. This can allow me to 
          return to my workload with a refreshed mind and hopefully a new perspective on what is 
          bothering me.</p>
        <p>If I need to seek help and have exhausted my other independent problem-solving methods, 
          then my plan in foundations is to clearly explain my problem in discord. During bootcamp 
          I will ask other students first before reaching out to facilitators, in person or in 
          discord. This will be done in a timely way by sticking to timeboxes and seeking help if 
          I’m exceeding the expected time frame.</p>
        <p>I don’t have a lot of expectations from the facilitation team in this programme. As I 
          struggle to reach out when I have a problem, my main expectation is that I would like to 
          have the support there and encouraged.</p>
        <p>I don’t have any set-in-stone commitments that I need to block out for scheduling. The 
          other main priority I have with time is my dog, as well as other dogs I have staying 
          occasionally. During foundations I will have about an hour or two blocked out for dog 
          walks, but this is very flexible, and during bootcamp this won’t be a problem as I have 
          other people helping me with this.</p>
