      <h3>Picture this: a beautiful S'mores delicacy.</h3>

      <p>If we want to take a deeper look into this beautiful creation, let's take the top cracker off to see what's inside.</p>
      <p>Sections of code on a website can visually be made up of 3 components. These are the margin, border, and padding. I like to think of it as having an additional component, which would be the content you're wanting to design around, for example text or images. This additional component can be looked at as a strawberry. An unconventional S'mores addition I know but bear with me.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Padding: this is the “padding” around the content, and is the space between the content and the next component. This is the marshmallow of our S'more. </li>
        <li>Border: this "borders" the padding as it lies outside of it but inside the next component. This is the chocolate of our S'more.</li>
        <li>Margin: this transparent layer encompasses the other layers and lies outside of the border. This is the cracker of our S'more. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Everyone likes their S'more ratio different. The width of each component is what defines your perfect S'more. Let's see what this looks like with code.</p>
      <p>Here's a colour code so you can follow along my analogy. </p>

      <p>Below is an average S'more, which is the product of code opened in a browser. In the code image, the HTML (left) and CSS (right) shows how I got to this.</p>

      <p>If you tell me that you like less marshmallow in your S'more, it's no problem! I can cater to this by adjusting the components as shown below.</p>

      <p>What's that, you want lots of marshmallow? Sure, can do! Here's how I can do that below.</p>
