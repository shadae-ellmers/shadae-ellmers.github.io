      <h2>Your Brain</h2>

      <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to adapt and change. More specifically, it is the brain’s ability to develop neural pathways and strengthen connections, as well as disposing the ones unneeded. Understanding the core principles is beneficial towards maximising learning growth.</p>
      <p>There are ten principles of neuroplasticity:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use it or lose it – without practice, connections will be severed to make room for other useful ones</li>
        <li>Use it and improve it – with practice and reaching for these connections, your brain will strengthen them</li>
        <li>Salience – adjusting your emotions and thought processes into making a task or information exciting and important, the information and neural pathways needed become important in your brain and strengthen</li>
        <li>Repetition – this is what solidifies information overtime in your brain by making your brain work to recall it and association</li>
        <li>Intensity – by challenging yourself, you can build stronger connections by creating new associations with what you’re learning</li>
        <li>Specificity – being intentional with what you learn instead of sticking to what is familiar</li>
        <li>Age – the young brain works better to adapt and grow</li>
        <li>Time – progress can happen at any time, with some times contributing to greater growth than others</li>
        <li>Transference – learning something can allow it to transfer into other contexts</li>
        <li>Interference – detrimental habits and working towards the wrong things can be degenerative to building connections</li>
      </ol>
      <p>At this point in the course, I have found that actively putting the content into practice is what helps my brain learn better. These principles can benefit me even further, as I can learn what chunks of the day I learn best in and utilise those by practicing with greater intensity.</p>
      <p>Increasing neuroplasticity comes with participating in high challenging activities and making sure your brain is in the best condition to learn. The ways that can benefit me specifically are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting enough sleep at night</li>
        <li>Revisiting stretch material in the curriculum</li>
        <li>Finding clarity in my value system</li>
        <li>Setting meaningful goals</li>
        <li>Journaling</li>
        <li>Going for small walks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Growth mindset is the idea that we can grow our brain’s capacity to learn, which occurs when challenging ourselves. This is relevant to this course as by adopting this growth mindsets, we can put ourselves in the best position to learn and know the content.</p>
      <p>What has changed for me after researching this idea is that I am constantly doubting my ability to understand new things, which puts me in a fixed mindset. By simply adjusting my thoughts to positive affirmations, I can take a small step towards better understanding of what I’m trying to tackle.</p>
      <p>There are a few steps I want to take to integrate growth mindset into my learning journey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change my perspective on failure from inability to part of the learning process</li>
        <li>Understand my own limitations to set realistic goals</li>
        <li>Approach challenges as opportunities for growth</li>
        <li>Stop seeking external approval</li>
      </ul>
