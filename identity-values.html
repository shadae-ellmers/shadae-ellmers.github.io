        <p>When I graduated from university, I really struggled looking for a job that was in the biomedical science field that wouldn’t drain my soul. I was asked to interview for an animal assistant role that required me to care for the experimental rats but unfortunately, also humanly end their life if necessary. When I heard of this piece of information, my heart suck to the floor. One half of me loves animals and is compassionate. The other half of me is driven and is determined to find a job to begin my science career no matter what. Ultimately, I decided that though both sides of me fought over high values of mine, killing animals was where I had to ethically draw the line, so I didn’t take the job. Reflecting on this decision, I’m glad I did pursue this road for me as I don’t believe the reward of the industry experience was worth compromising my morality.</p>
        <p>Growing up I rarely felt security in my home and so, this has taught me to be independent as I could only rely on myself. I feel as though neither my culture nor the people around me majorly influence who I am. What I value has been based on my own research and experience, and that if someone close to me differs, I don’t let it impact me.</p>
        <p>Before researching and writing this blog post, I had no idea what my strengths were. Through quizzes, reading, and talking with others, I now believe I have two major strengths. Firstly, I use humour to try to put people in a good mood and show positivity in anything. This will support me in my learning as I can make the learning process fun and exciting, as laughter releases dopamine and so, activates the brain’s reward system. Therefore, I can simulate this through making memes or cartoons related to the content I am learning. Secondly, I thrive with creativity and love all modes of storytelling and art. This will support me in my learning by utilising visual learning tools, such as drawing diagrams and colour association, to stimulate my brain and make content easier to understand.</p>
        <p>I didn’t know my strengths before this task, I most definitely didn’t what to acknowledge my personal flaws. Through the same resources, I believe I have two major limitations to my growth. The first is sociability, which I already had an inkling would show up from research. As an introvert who also struggles with anxiety, communicating with others and putting myself out there is hard for me. This really affects my learning journey as it hinders me from asking for help when I need it and involving myself in group learning sessions. The second limitation I have is indecisiveness, as I find it difficult to make a choice when there is no obvious right answer. Though I’m good at getting all the information needed to decide and analyzing it to conclude, I struggle to know what to do. This affects my learning journey as it can take me longer than necessary to complete a task when making multiple choices and hinder my productivity.</p>
        <p>This project has opened my eyes to who I am, deeper than I tried exploring before. Now I have a better understanding of what can aid me in creating a better learning strategy as well as what I can work on to develop.</p>
